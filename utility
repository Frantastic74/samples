# cutil cloud utility

The **cutil** cloud utility manages devices and deployments in the cloud and enables fine-grained control over every deployment detail. 


## Compound commands

To streamline deployment for typical applications, **cutil** includes the following compound commands, which can perform many operations at once:

- **cutil component** [publish](###publish)
- **cutil component** [debugprep](###debugprep)
- **cutil device** [fieldprep](###fieldprep)
- **cutil device** [linktofeed](###linktofeed)

## Cutil commands

**cutil** provides the following commands, with full and abbreviated names:

Command | Description
-------| ------
[**component, com**](#component) | Creates and manages components and images in the cloud.
[**device, dev**](#device) | Manages devices in the cloud.
[**devicegroup, dg**](#devicegroup) | Creates and manages device groups in the cloud.
[**feed, f**](#feed) | Creates and manages feeds in the cloud.
[**imageset, ims**](#imageset) |Creates and manages image sets in the cloud.
[**login**](#login) | Provides login to the Azure Sphere tenant. By default, all cutil commands apply to the current userâ€™s AAD login identity and tenant. The login command lets you use a different identity.
[**sku**](#sku) | Creates and manages SKUs in the cloud.

### Syntax

`cutil <command> <operation> <flags>`

### Universal flags

Universal flags can be used with any **cutil** command.

Flag | Description
-------| ------
-v, --verbose | Provides verbose output.
-?, --help | Displays help on the commands. 

### cutil identifiers

Many cutil operations require a unique name **and** a unique ID or GUID that identifies the element (com, dev, dg, f, ims, or SKU), on which to operate. They must possess both a:

- **Unique name**: If the element name is not unique to the tenant, **cutil** returns an error message "The *name* already exists."
- **GUID**: When only one such ID is required, operations typically use -i to abbreviate, regardless of the long name of the associated flag.

## component

The **component** command creates and manages components and images in the cloud. Include a subcommand for this command to succeed at runtime. Currently, seven subcommands operate specifically to component or com. 

Operation | Description
--- | ---
[**addimage, addimg**](#addimageset) | Uploads a new image and adds it to a component.
[**create** ](#create)| Creates a new component.
[**getimage, getimg** ](#getimage)| Downloads an existing image from the cloud.
[**getimagemetadata, getimgmeta** ](#getimagemetadata)| Downloads the metadata for an existing image.
[**list** ](#list)|	Lists all components in the current tenant.
[**publish** ](#publish)|	Uploads a new image, adds it to a new image set, and adds the image set to an existing feed.

### addimage

The **addimage** operation uploads a new image to the cloud and adds it to a component. The component ID is not required because **cutil** reads it from the application manifest. Use the --autocreatecomponent (-c) flag to create the component if it does not already exist. 

<details><summary>Flags</summary>
<p>

Flag | Description
-------| ------
-c, --autocreatecomponent | Creates a new component for the image if one does not already exist.

Command completed successfully in 00:00:06.1894094.
```

### publish

The **publish** operation "publishes" a new image set for an existing component to an existing feed. It uploads a new image, adds it to a new image set, and adds the new image set to an existing feed. It combines the tasks of several other **cutil** commands:

- **cutil com addimg**
- **cutil imageset create**
- **cutil feed addimageset**

<details><summary>Flags</summary>
<p>

Flag | Description
-------| ------
-f, --feedid *GUID* | Specifies the GUID of the feed to which to add the image set. The feed must already exist and must deliver a component that has the same component ID as the specified image. Required.
-i, --imagepath *filepath* | Specifies the path and filename of the image to upload. The command auto-generates a component ID based on the information in the image package if a component with that ID does not already exist. Required.
-n, --newimagesetname *string* | Specifies a name for the new image set to be created. The name must be unique within the tenant. If omitted, a name is generated from the image metadata. Optional.
</p>
</details>

#### Example

The following example uploads a new image for the existing Mt3620Blink3 component, creates an image set, and adds the image set to a feed that delivers the Mt3620Blink3 component.

```sh
cutil com publish -f d755a1b9-192d-4769-aad5-5d579178242f -i "C:\Users\User\Source\Repos\Mt3620Blink3\Mt3620Blink3\bin\ARM\Debug\Mt3620Blink3.imagepackage"
Publishing image 'C:\Users\User\Source\Repos\Mt3620Blink3\Mt3620Blink3\bin\ARM\Debug\Mt3620Blink3.imagepackage' to feed with ID 'd755a1b9-192d-4769-aad5-5d579178242f'.
Uploading image from file 'C:\Users\User\Source\Repos\Mt3620Blink3\Mt3620Blink3\bin\ARM\Debug\Mt3620Blink3.imagepackage':
 --> Image ID:       '4eb71b48-16a2-4f31-a338-bb8c0e5f7386'
 --> Component ID:   '16995a70-377f-4bd2-b29d-1b0fffcbe287'
 --> Component name: 'Mt3620Blink3'
Creating new image set with name 'ImageSet-Mt3620Blink3-2018.04.26-14.33.07' for image with ID '4eb71b48-16a2-4f31-a338-bb8c0e5f7386'.
Adding image set with ID 'adfd80e1-43d9-4359-99fe-31df0c834d7a' to feed with ID 'd755a1b9-192d-4769-aad5-5d579178242f'.
Successfully published image 'C:\Users\User\Source\Repos\Mt3620Blink3\Mt3620Blink3\bin\ARM\Debug\Mt3620Blink3.imagepackage' to feed with ID 'd755a1b9-192d-4769-aad5-5d579178242f'.
Command completed successfully in 00:00:11.3067837.
```

The command did not include the optional --newimagesetname flag, so **cutil** creates a name that includes the filename of the image package and a timestamp. The **cutil imageset get** command shows the details for this image set:

#### Example

```sh
cutil ims get -i adfd80e1-43d9-4359-99fe-31df0c834d7a
Getting image set with ID 'adfd80e1-43d9-4359-99fe-31df0c834d7a'.
Successfully retrieved image set 'adfd80e1-43d9-4359-99fe-31df0c834d7a':
 --> ID:   [adfd80e1-43d9-4359-99fe-31df0c834d7a]
 --> Name: 'ImageSet-Mt3620Blink3-2018.04.26-14.33.07'
Images to be installed:
 --> [ID: 4eb71b48-16a2-4f31-a338-bb8c0e5f7386]
Command completed successfully in 00:00:04.7822167.

Command completed successfully in 00:00:05.5459143.
```

### debugprep

The **debugprep** operation sets up the attached device for local debugging by enabling the appDevelopment capability and assigning the device to a device group that does not apply OTA application updates; it leaves any existing applications on the device. The appDevelopment capability enables you to sideload SDK-signed image packages to the device and to start, stop, debug, and delete any image package from the device. This command works only on an attached device.  

This command combines the work of several other **cutil** commands:

- **cutil device getcapability -type appDevelopment**Â 
- **cutil devicegroup get**Â 
- **cutil device setdevicegroup**
- **cutil device applycapability**

<details><summary>Flags</summary>
<p>

Flag | Description
-------| ------
-d, --devicegroupid *GUI* | Specifies an existing device group that does not enable OTA updates for applications. If this flag is omitted, the operation assigns the device to a Microsoft-created default group that does not apply OTA updates to applications. If your device is already a member of a device group that does not enable application updates and you want it to remain in that group, supply the device group ID with this flag. Optional
</p>
</details>

#### Example

```sh
cutil dev debugprep

Getting device capability configuration for application development.
Downloading device capability configuration for device ID 'ABCDE082513B529C45098884F882B2CA6D832587CAAE1A90B1CEC4A376EA2F22A96C4E7E1FC4D2AFF5633B68DB68FF4420A5588B420851EE4F3F1A7DC51399ED'.

Command completed successfully in 00:00:17.1861625.
```

### fieldprep

The **fieldprep** operation sets up a device to receive OTA updates, deletes any existing applications, and removes the appDevelopment capability. It requires a device to be attached to the PC and operates only on the attached device. It combines the work of several other **cutil** and **dutil** commands:

- **dutil sideload delete**
- **cutil device getcapability --type none**
- **cutil sku create**
- **cutil device setsku**
- **cutil devicegroup create**
- **cutil device setdevicegroup**
- **cutil device applycapability**

The specific tasks that **fieldprep** performs depend on the whether a product SKU and device group have already been assigned for this device. If the product SKU or the device group does not already exist, the command creates it and assigns it to the device, provided that a SKU name or a device group name is supplied with the appropriate flag. See [Examples](#example-10) for details.  

<details><summary>Flags</summary>
<p>

Flag  | Description
-------| ------
 -r, --devicegroupid *Guid*| Sets the ID of the device group to which to add the device. If this flag is omitted, the command creates a new device group and enables application updates for the new group. Either --devicegroupid or --newdevicegroupname is required
 -g, --newdevicegroupname *String* | Specifies a name for the new device group to create. The name must be unique within the tenant. Use this flag only if you have not already set up a device group for OTA updates. Whenever possible, use an existing device group to avoid cluttering the tenant with unneeded groups.
-n, --newskuname *String* | Specifies a name for the new product SKU to create for the device. The name must be unique within the tenant. Use this flag only if you do not use the --skuid flag. If you already have a product SKU that is appropriate for this device, supply it with the --skuid flag to avoid cluttering your tenant with numerous SKUs that are only used once. If neither the --newskuname nor the --skuid flag is present, the command checks whether the device already has a product SKU and if so, uses it; otherwise, the command fails.
-d, --skudescription *String*  | Specifies a string that describes the new product SKU to create. Ignored if the device already has a product SKU.
-s --skuid *GUID* | Assigns an existing product SKU to the device.
</p>
</details>

#### Examples

Example 1. Create a product SKU and device group for device

This example creates a new product SKU and a new device group, and assigns both to the attached device.

```sh
cutil dev fieldprep --newdevicegroupname AppUpdateGroup --newskuname TestSKU
```

As the output shows, the command deletes the existing application from the device, removes the appDevelopment capability, creates a device group named AppUpdateGroup, creates a product SKU named TestSKU, and assigns both the device group and the product SKU to the attached device. The new device group is enabled for OTA loading of application updates.

Command completed successfully in 00:00:12.0638169.
```
Example 3. Assign device to different device group

This example is similar to the preceding example, but retains the existing product SKU for the device. Here the **fieldprep** operation changes the device group to which the device belongs and removes the appDevelopment capability. This command is useful for moving a device from a development environment that does not enable OTA application updates to a production environment that does.

```sh 
cutil device fieldprep --devicegroupid 64dbcfd8-ef37-496a-8761-b755c6af8266

### linktofeed

The **linktofeed** operation provides an abbreviated way to deploy an application. It creates a feed and assigns that feed to the devices in the same device group as a specified device. It combines the tasks of the following **cutil** commands:

- **cutil component addimage**
- **cutil feed create**Â 
- **cutil devicegroup addfeed**
- **cutil imageset create** 
- **cutil feed addimageset**

<details><summary>Flags</summary>
<p>

Flags  | Description
-------| ------
-a, --attached | Selects the device group to which the attached the Azure Sphere device belongs. Either the --attached flag or the --deviceid flag is required.
-c, --componentid *GUID* | Specifies the component ID of the application. If you use the --newfeedname flag to create a new feed, you must also supply either the --componentid or the --imagepath flag.
-d, --dependentfeedid *GUID* | Specifies the ID of the dependent feed for the application. Application feeds depend on the latest Azure Sphere OS feed, which is currently named Preview MT3620 Feed. Required when creating a new feed.
-i, --deviceid *String* | Selects the device group for the Azure Sphere device with the specified device ID. Either the --attached flag or the --deviceid flag is required.
-f, --feedid *GUID* | Specifies the ID of the feed to link to the device group for the specified device. If you omit this flag, **cutil** creates a new feed and assigns it the friendly name that you specify with the optional --newfeedname flag. If you already have a feed for this component, use it to avoid cluttering your tenant with redundant feeds. Either the --feedid flag or the --newfeedname flag is required.
-p, --imagepath *String* | Specifies the path to the image package to upload. If you omit this flag, the feed is created but is not assigned an initial image set. Optional.
-n, --newfeedname *GUID* | Specifies a friendly name for the new feed. Use only if you do not specify a feed ID with the --feedid flag. If you use the --newfeedname flag to create a new feed, you must also supply either the --componentid or the --imagepath flag. Either the --feedid flag or the --newfeedname flag is required.
-s, --newimagesetname *String* | Specifies a friendly name for the new image set that the command creates when you use the --imagepath flag. The name must be unique within the tenant. If you specify an image path but not an image set name, **cutil** automatically generates a name for the image set.
</p>
</details>

#### Examples

The first example creates a new feed, a new component, and a new image set. The new feed depends on the Preview MT3620 feed and is named BlinkLink. 

```sh
cutil device linktofeed --attached --dependentfeedid edd33e66-9b68-44c8-9d23-eb60f2e5018b --imagepath "C:\Users\User\Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Projects\Mt3620Blink5\Mt3620Blink5\bin\ARM\Debug\Mt3620Blink5.imagepackage" --newfeedname Model100AppFeedOTA --newimagesetname Model100Appv1.0

Command completed successfully in 00:00:25.5193828.
```

The next example creates a new feed for an existing component. The feed is dependent on the Preview MT3620 Feed and is named BlinkLink. The feed services the devices in the same device group as the attached device.  

```sh
cutil dev linktofeed -a -c 16995a70-377f-4bd2-b29d-1b0fffcbe287 -n BlinkLink --dependentfeedid edd33e66-9b68-44c8-9d23-eb60f2e5018b

Command completed successfully in 00:00:07.1315217.
```

The **cutil feed get** command shows the resulting feed. No image sets are associated with the feed because the preceding **cutil dev linktofeed** command did not specify an image path. You can later add an image set to the feed by using the **cutil feed addims** command.

```sh
cutil feed get -i 6daf66aa-5a3e-41f9-9659-6c30a2f7673f
```

```

### create

The **create** operation creates a new device group and assigns it a friendly name. Device group names must be unique within the tenant. 

By default, application software updates are enabled for all device groups, so that devices receive OTA deployments of application software automatically. You can change this default by specifying the --noapplicationupdates (-a) flag when you create a group. Disabling updates means that the devices in the group will not receive OTA updates and must instead be updated by sideloading, either through Visual Studio or by using the [**dutil sideload**](dutil.md#sideload) command.

## login

The **login** option provides login to the Azure Sphere tenant.

When you use **cutil**, the Azure Sphere services verify your identity by using Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AAD). AAD uses Single Sign-On (SSO), which  typically defaults to an existing identity on your PC. If this identity is not valid for use with the Azure Sphere tenant, **cutil** commands may fail.

The **cutil login** command enables you to sign in explicitly to Azure Sphere services. Upon success, this identity is used for subsequent **cutil** commands. In most cases, you should only have to sign in once.

#### Example

`cutil login`

In response, you should see a dialog box that lists your credentials or prompts you to log in. If the list includes the identity that you use for Azure Sphere, choose that identity. If not, enter the appropriate credentials.
